# Linear agent integration

Part 2 of [RFC #4492](https://github.com/kubestellar/hive/issues/4492)
("converse capability + Linear agents as first-class workspace members").
With this integration a hive joins a Linear workspace **as an agent**: it can
be assigned or @-mentioned on issues, it acknowledges each agent session
within Linear's 10-second budget, kicks a configured hive agent to do the
work, and narrates completion back into the session as agent activities.

Part 1 ([#4515](https://github.com/kubestellar/hive/pull/4515)) added the
`converse` capability; the `api.linear.app` proxy enforcement (component F)
merged in [#4522](https://github.com/kubestellar/hive/pull/4522).

## Architecture

```
Linear                          hive spoke
──────                          ──────────
issue delegated to app ──webhook──▶ POST /api/linear/webhook   (public; HMAC = credential)
                                      │  verify Linear-Signature + ±60s replay window
                                      │  respond 200 immediately (5s budget)
                                      ▼
                                  Responder (pkg/linearagent)
                                      │  1. post `thought` activity  ◀── SYNCHRONOUS, ≤8s deadline
                                      │     (never waits on the governor loop or tmux)
                                      │  2. resolve session agent (config, no I/O)
                                      │  3. SendKick(agent, issue context)
                                      │  4. post `action` activity ("Delegated")
                                      ▼
                                  agent works (tmux CLI session)
                                      │
                              kick log archived (next rotation point, #4296)
                                      ▼
                                  kick observer → `response` activity, session finished
```

The <10s acknowledgement never depends on the governor's `eval_interval_s`
(300s) or on agent startup: the thought is posted synchronously on webhook
receipt, before the kick is even attempted. A kick refusal (paused agent,
unknown agent) is reported into the session as an `error` activity.

Completion detection is intentionally coarse: a run "ends" at the next kick-log
rotation point (a newer kick, an agent restart, shutdown). There is no
mid-run streaming of agent output into Linear yet.

## Setup

1. **Create a Linear OAuth application** (Linear → Settings → API →
   Applications) with:
   - Callback URL: `https://<your-hive>/linear/callback`
   - Webhooks enabled, URL `https://<your-hive>/api/linear/webhook`,
     with the **Agent session events** category checked. Copy the signing
     secret.
2. **Set the environment variables** on the hive (see
   [env-vars.md](env-vars.md#linear-agent-integration)):
   `LINEAR_CLIENT_ID`, `LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
3. **Tell the hive its public origin** when the dashboard is not reached at
   `https://<your-hive>` directly. The `redirect_uri` the hive sends Linear
   is built from, in order: `dashboard.public_url`, then `hub.dashboard_url`
   (hub-hosted spokes only), then the request's
   `X-Forwarded-Proto`/`X-Forwarded-Host`/`Host`. Set the first one on a
   standalone (`hub.enabled: false`) hive whose dashboard is private but
   whose `/linear/callback` is published on another hostname, or that sits
   behind an ingress that rewrites the `Host` header (Traefik with a fixed
   upstream `Host`, a Cloudflare Tunnel "HTTP Host Header") — otherwise the
   install request and the callback request derive different origins and
   Linear refuses the code exchange with `redirect_uri is invalid`:

   ```yaml
   dashboard:
     public_url: https://hive.example.com   # origin only: no path or query
   ```

   It must be an absolute `http(s)://` origin; a path, query, fragment or
   credentials fail config load with a clear error, and a trailing slash is
   trimmed. It is honored from the seed config (`hive.yaml`). Do **not** reach
   for `hub.dashboard_url` on a hub-less hive — it is the hub's notion of the
   spoke's dashboard link and stays only as the fallback for hub-hosted
   spokes.
4. **Connect the workspace**: as an owner, `POST /api/linear/agent/install`
   returns an `authorize_url` and the `redirect_uri` it was built with — that
   `redirect_uri` is the exact value the Linear app's Callback URL must match,
   so check it here rather than decoding the authorize URL. Open the
   `authorize_url` in a browser and approve the app for the workspace (the
   flow uses `actor=app` and the `app:assignable,app:mentionable` scopes, so
   the app becomes an assignable, mentionable workspace member). Linear
   redirects back to `/linear/callback`, and the hive stores the workspace
   grant + its per-workspace app user id at `LINEAR_AGENT_STORE`
   (default `/data/linear-agent.json`).
5. **Pick the session agent** in `hive.yaml` when the hive runs more than one
   agent:

   ```yaml
   governor:
     work_source:
       linear:
         session_agent: scanner   # agent that takes Linear sessions
   ```

   With exactly one configured agent this is implicit.
6. **Optional — enumerate only delegated/assigned issues**: when the Linear
   work source is active, `assigned_only: true` narrows backlog enumeration to
   issues assigned **or delegated** to the app user (Linear sets `delegate`,
   not `assignee`, when an issue is handed to an agent):

   ```yaml
   governor:
     work_source:
       type: linear
       linear:
         api_key: ${LINEAR_API_KEY}
         assigned_only: true
   ```

   This fails closed: `assigned_only` without a connected Linear agent is a
   startup error, never "enumerate everything".

`GET /api/linear/agent/status` (owner) reports configuration, the connected
workspace, the resolved session agent, and recent sessions.
`POST /api/linear/agent/disconnect` (owner) forgets the stored grant (revoke
the app itself from Linear's settings).

## GitHub-issue parity: agents writing to Linear

With the pieces above a hive could *read* Linear and *acknowledge* sessions,
but an agent still had no way to do the tracker half of its policy —
file an issue, comment, cite the issue from a PR — against Linear. The
policy templates are written for GitHub Issues (`gh issue create`,
`Fixes #N`, the `hold` label), and the proxy's mutation allowlist was gated
but nothing reachable: no agent held a Linear credential. Parity is built
the same way the GitHub path is, from the config that already exists:

| GitHub Issues | Linear | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| App installation token, tier-scoped, pushed as `GITHUB_TOKEN` to push-capable agents and refreshed hourly | The connected app's OAuth token pushed as `LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Bearer) to **ISSUES_ONLY+** agents; falls back to `work_source.linear.api_key` as `LINEAR_API_KEY`; re-pushed on the same hourly refresh tick | `agent.Manager.SetLinearCredentialResolver`, wired in `main.go` from `dashboard.Server.LinearAgentAccessToken` |
| Advisory agents have `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` stripped | Advisory agents have both Linear variables stripped from the tmux session | `ensureTmuxSession` |
| Writes authored by the App bot | Writes authored by the Hive app user (the same identity that acknowledges sessions) | `actor=app` grant |
| `${GH_AUTH}` explains auth; templates give `gh issue create` and `Fixes #N` | A **Work Tracker: Linear** section rendered from `work_source.linear` (team → repo map, states, hold labels, `assigned_only`) and injected into every kick at the same post-resolution seam as held-PR coordination, so customized templates cannot omit it; `${WORK_TRACKER}` places it explicitly | `pkg/scheduler/work_tracker.go` |
| `Fixes #N` auto-closes on merge | Linear's GitHub integration: identifier in the branch name or `Fixes TEAM-123` in the PR body links the PR, moves the issue to In Progress when it opens and Done when it merges; `Part of` / `Refs` / `Contributes to` are the non-closing forms | Linear-side, nothing hive-specific |
| REST route table gates writes by tier | GraphQL operation allowlist gates writes by tier (below) | `pkg/proxy/linear_rules.go` |

Nothing changes for a GitHub-sourced hive: with no Linear credential the
resolver injects nothing and the tracker section is empty.

Agents are told **not** to change the state of PR-driven issues by hand —
Linear's GitHub integration owns that transition, exactly as GitHub's
`Fixes` keyword owns issue closure. Make sure the integration is enabled
for the workspace and the repos in `work_source.linear.teams[].repo` are
connected to it.

### Session kicks and governor kicks

A delegated issue reaches the hive twice: the webhook opens an agent
session (kicked immediately to `session_agent`), and — with
`assigned_only: true` — the same issue is enumerated into the governor's
backlog on the next sweep. This mirrors GitHub, where a webhook-channel kick
and a governor kick for the same issue also coexist. The governor kick
rotates the session's kick log, which the responder reports into the
session as "finished this run"; the follow-on run carries on with the same
identifier in its work list.

## Proxy enforcement

Agent-side calls to `api.linear.app` go through the ACMM proxy
(`pkg/proxy/linear_rules.go`, merged in #4522): a deny-by-default GraphQL
mutation allowlist where `agentActivityCreate`/`agentSessionUpdate` are
reachable at every tier (they carry the 10-second session invariant),
`issueUpdate`/`commentCreate` require ISSUES_ONLY, and anything unknown or
unparseable is denied. The control-plane client in `pkg/linearagent` (webhook
ack, identity query, token refresh) runs in the hive process itself, not
through the agent proxy.

## What requires a live workspace to verify

CI exercises every component against recording fakes; these behaviors depend
on Linear's side of the contract and need a manual pass against a real
workspace:

1. **OAuth install**: authorize with `actor=app` and confirm the app appears
   as an assignable, mentionable member; callback lands with
   `?linear=connected` and status shows the workspace + `viewer_id`.
2. **Webhook signatures**: real deliveries verify against
   `LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (bare hex HMAC in `Linear-Signature`, no
   `sha256=` prefix) and pass the ±60s `webhookTimestamp` window.
3. **Ack timing**: delegate an issue to the app and confirm the session shows
   the thought within 10s (the responder's deadline is 8s).
4. **Prompt field positions**: `prompted` events are parsed from
   `agentActivity.content.body` with a fallback to `agentActivity.body`, and
   issue context from `promptContext` at both the top level and under
   `agentSession` — confirm real payloads land in one of those.
5. **Delegate filter**: with `assigned_only: true`, confirm delegated issues
   (Linear sets `delegate`) are enumerated and unrelated backlog is not.
6. **Token refresh**: after ~24h, confirm the stored access token refreshes
   transparently (30-minute grace window; the old refresh token is kept when
   the response omits a new one).
7. **Agent writes**: from an ISSUES_ONLY+ agent session, confirm
   `LINEAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set (and absent in an advisory session), that an
   `issueCreate` lands authored by the Hive app user, and that an `issueDelete`
   is refused by the proxy with a 403 naming the operation.
8. **PR auto-link**: open a PR on a branch named `<agent>/team-123-slug` with
   `Fixes TEAM-123` in the body and confirm Linear attaches it and moves the
   issue to In Progress, then Done on merge.
