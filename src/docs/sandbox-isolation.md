# Credential-free sandbox isolation

## Threat model

Hive agents are untrusted code executors: prompts, tool output, and cloned repositories can all contain hostile instructions. The safe target is therefore **no credentials in the agent sandbox** and a network policy that is as close to default-deny as the configured inference runtime allows.

Two halves of that target hold differently, and the difference matters:

- **Credentials and pushes are constrained on every path.** No agent receives a GitHub token or pushes directly; authorship goes through the App-gated `gh` wrapper and the push broker.
- **Workspace confinement holds only on the sandbox path below.** "It can only modify its mounted workspace" is a property of the Podman sandbox, not of hive generally. On the default tmux path there is no container: the backend CLI runs as the operator's own user, on the operator's own host, with nothing scoping its filesystem access to the workspace.

**#4918 is what that costs in practice, and it did not require a compromise.** An agent doing correct work on an assigned third-party repo ran that repo's own test suite; a latent defect in two of its tests let a hook escape its stubs and issue `rpm-ostree kargs --append-if-missing=...` against the operator's real deployment. Nothing was written, and the only reason is that the process happened to lack privilege. Benign behaviour was a sufficient precondition, so this is a routine exposure rather than an exceptional one.

The claude-family launch path now carries host-state denials for exactly this class — privilege escalation (`sudo`, `pkexec`, `doas`, `su`) and the boot/deployment tools that reach polkit without needing escalation of their own (`rpm-ostree`, `bootc`, `ostree`, `grubby`, `bootctl`, `efibootmgr`), matching the workspace-write posture Codex has had since #3512. That is a floor, not a sandbox: it names commands rather than enforcing a boundary, and an agent still runs unconfined against everything not on the list.

## Which confinement is available depends on the path you are on

This is the part that is easy to get wrong, because the two paths have different levers and only one of them has the Podman sandbox at all.

| | Hub / pod agents (`pkg/agent`) | Contributor relay (`just contribute-hive`) |
|---|---|---|
| Runs where | The hive spoke's own container | The contributor's machine |
| Podman agent sandbox (`agent_sandbox`) | Available, opt-in — see below | **Does not exist on this path.** `SandboxEnabled` is read only by `pkg/agent`; nothing in `bin/contributor-relay.sh`, `bin/contributor-agent.sh` or the `Justfile` consults it |
| The confinement lever | `agent_sandbox` + the per-agent opt-in | **Container mode vs local mode** — `just contribute-hive` defaults to container; `... local` is the unconfined one |
| Host-state denials (#4938) | Yes | Yes (`config/backends.conf`) |
| Credentials / pushes | Constrained | Constrained |

**The #4918 incident happened on the contributor relay's local mode**, so enabling `agent_sandbox` would not have prevented it. The remedy on that path is container mode, which `just contribute-hive` already uses by default and now warns about when it is not.

Operators running hive on a machine they care about should therefore: use container mode on the contributor path, and enable the sandbox below on the hub path.

## Current wiring

Sandbox execution is opt-in and the tmux path remains unchanged for all agents unless **both** gates are set — the global one and a per-agent one:

```yaml
agent_sandbox:
  enabled: true
  image: ghcr.io/example/hive-agent:latest
  # Default is "restricted" so local/proxy inference can still work.
  # Use "none" for non-inference/test runs that require full network isolation.
  network_mode: restricted
  timeout_s: 2700
agents:
  scanner:
    sandbox:
      enabled: true
```

**Both gates are required, and the global one alone does nothing.** `agent_sandbox.enabled: true` with no per-agent `sandbox.enabled: true` sandboxes zero agents. That matters more than it reads, because the dashboard's Security tab writes *only* the global flag and is the only sandbox control the UI offers: an owner can turn "agent sandbox" on, be told the setting was updated, and have every agent keep running unconfined. Hive now logs a `agent sandbox posture` warning at boot and on every config reload when the sandbox is enabled globally but some or all agents are not opted in (`config.AgentSandboxGateWarnings`).

The second gate is deliberate rather than an oversight, and it is not safe to simply collapse. A sandboxed agent runs a different execution model — no tmux CLI at all, and every kick is a Podman run against the primary repo — and `startSandboxKickLocked` has **no fallback to the tmux path**: an agent opted in without a resolvable image fails every kick outright rather than degrading. Making the global flag sufficient would therefore convert working agents into permanently failing ones on any hive that set it without an image. Changing that default is a fleet-affecting decision that wants measurement, not a code-reading; the warning above is the part that is safe today.

For sandboxed agents, a kick now follows this path:

1. Hive prepares a per-kick host workspace under the sandbox workspace root by cloning/fetching the primary repo with hive-owned credentials before the sandbox starts. The clone URL and sandbox environment are sanitized so GitHub/token variables are not carried into the workspace or container.
2. Hive writes the kick prompt to `.hive/kick-prompt.txt` in the workspace and launches `pkg/sandbox.Launcher` with a rootless Podman `LaunchSpec`, workspace mount, explicit env allowlist, and configured network mode.
3. The manager marks the agent busy while the sandbox runs and returns it to idle or failed when the timeout/completion path finishes. Dashboard status uses the existing agent status structures.
4. Hive collects the transcript at `.hive/sandbox-transcript.log` and any `agent-report*.json` artifact following `pkg/outputschema` conventions.
5. If the sandbox produced commits, `pkg/pushbroker.Broker` scans the committed diff for token-like secrets and protected-path edits, mints a short-lived scoped GitHub App token outside the sandbox, pushes the branch, and opens a PR through the existing App-authored GitHub client. Broker rejection records audit detail and nothing is pushed.

## Network trade-off

`network_mode: none` remains available and maps to Podman's `--network=none`, but it only works for non-inference jobs or runtimes that already expose a local/socket model proxy inside the container. The default sandbox network mode is `restricted`: operators must provide a Podman network/proxy policy that allows only the inference endpoint and MITM proxy required by the selected backend. This is a compromise until every supported backend can run through a credential-free local socket without general egress.

## Remaining gaps

- The default target is the hive primary repo and default base ref; richer per-kick repo/ref selection is still future work.
- Live Podman execution is covered by skip-when-absent tests; CI still needs a rootless-Podman runner lane for always-on integration coverage.
- Sandboxed inference depends on an operator-provided restricted network/proxy policy. `none` is stronger but not yet usable for all model backends.

## Agent guardrails (defense in depth)

Beyond the credential-free sandbox above, Hive's isolation model is defense in depth rather than a single sandbox switch. Agents run as long-lived CLI sessions, but the deterministic pipeline and proxy layers decide what work they see and what writes they can perform.

### Isolation layers

1. **Policy mode** — ACMM selects advisory, measured, hold-gated, or full behavior per agent.
2. **Deterministic admission** — Go and shell checks classify work, apply holds, and decide whether an agent is kicked.
3. **Scoped credentials** — contributor relays and spoke agents use the GitHub identity and token scope appropriate to that actor; a delegated ClankeR role does not grant spoke secrets.
4. **MITM GitHub proxy** — GitHub API writes are attributed and constrained according to the current mode.
5. **Merge gates** — hold labels, green checks, self-merge bans, and auto-merge sweeps are enforced outside the LLM prompt.

### Operator notes

- Prefer the least-capable ACMM level that matches the project phase.
- Keep privileged delegated roles (`ci-maintainer`, `sec-check`, `architect`) behind explicit grants.
- Use the docs in this index for concrete setup: [ACMM policy matrix](acmm-policy-matrix.md), [Agent configuration](agent-configuration.md), and [Contributor trust tiers and delegated agent roles](contributor-trust-and-roles.md).
